How a DHCP Server Assigns IP Addresses to Devices in a Network
	A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration settings to devices in a network. 	This process ensures efficient IP management without manual configuration.

	Steps of DHCP IP Address Assignment
		1. DHCP Discovery (Client to Server)
			When a device (client) connects to a network, it broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER packet.
			This packet is sent to the entire network (255.255.255.255) to find an available DHCP server.
			The client does not have an IP address yet, so it uses 0.0.0.0 as the source IP.
		2. DHCP Offer (Server to Client)
			A DHCP server responds with a DHCPOFFER packet.
			This includes:
				An available IP address for the client.
				The subnet mask.
				The default gateway (router).
				The DNS server IPs.
				The lease duration (time the IP is valid).
		3. DHCP Request (Client → Server)
			The client sends a DHCPREQUEST packet to confirm acceptance of the offered IP address.
			This request is broadcasted, ensuring all DHCP servers are aware of the selection.
		4. DHCP Acknowledgment (Server → Client)
			The DHCP server finalizes the process with a DHCPACK packet.
			This confirms the assigned IP address and configuration.
			The client is now able to communicate on the network.
	Key Components of DHCP IP Assignment
	
		Lease Time: Duration the IP address is valid before renewal is needed.
		Subnet Mask: Defines the network's size and range of IPs.
		Default Gateway: The router that connects the network to other networks.
		DNS Servers: Helps resolve domain names to IP addresses.
