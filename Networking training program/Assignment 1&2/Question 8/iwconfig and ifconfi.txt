Before diving into the explanation let's learn about why we didn't get any network in iwconfig in our VM machine (attached Screenshot). The reason
behind it is that iwconfig will only scan the wireless interface. it will not scan the wired interface. whereas the ifconfig will scan the wired and wireless interfaces.


1. Understanding iwconfig (Wireless Interfaces)
The iwconfig command is used to display and configure wireless network interfaces.

Basic Usage:

iwconfig

Output Example:

wlan0     IEEE 802.11  ESSID:"MyWiFi"  
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.437 GHz  Access Point: 12:34:56:78:90:AB   
          Bit Rate=54 Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm   
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off  
          Power Management:off  
          Link Quality=70/70  Signal level=-30 dBm  
Key Parameters:
	ESSID → The name of the connected WiFi network.
	Mode → Managed (connected to an access point) or Ad-Hoc (peer-to-peer).
	Frequency → The wireless channel being used.
	Access Point → The MAC address of the router.
	Bit Rate → The current transmission speed (e.g., 54 Mb/s).
	Tx-Power → The transmission power of the interface.
	Signal Level → Quality of the wireless signal.
	Modify Wireless Interface Settings:
	
2. Understanding ifconfig (Wired and Wireless Interfaces)
	The ifconfig command provides detailed information about all network interfaces, including IP addresses, MAC addresses, MTU, and speed.

Basic Usage:

ifconfig

Output Example:

eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E  
          inet addr:192.168.1.100  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0  
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1  
          RX packets:1048576 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0  
          TX packets:524288 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0  
          Collisions:0  txqueuelen:1000  
          RX bytes:104857600 (100.0 MB)  TX bytes:52428800 (50.0 MB)  
Key Parameters:
	inet addr → The assigned IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100).
	HWaddr → The MAC address of the interface.
	MTU → The Maximum Transmission Unit (default is 1500 bytes).
	RX/TX packets → The number of received and transmitted packets.
	Errors/Dropped → Indicates any network issues or packet loss.
	txqueuelen → The length of the transmission queue.
